# Invoice Parser Teaching Plan - Comprehensive Testing Plan

## Testing Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for all 10 steps of the Invoice Parser teaching plan. Each step will be tested for:

1. **Starting Code Integrity** - Verify starting code matches previous step's ending code
2. **Ending Code Functionality** - Ensure all features work as expected
3. **Teacher Notes Quality** - Check documentation is complete and beginner-friendly
4. **Progressive Enhancement** - Confirm each step builds upon the previous
5. **Final Completeness** - Verify Step-010 contains all features from invoice_parser-main

## Testing Methodology

### For Backend (API) Testing
