<task>Create engineering plan from product requirements</task>

<objective>
Transform requirements into actionable plan that:
- Breaks down into ordered user stories and tasks (logical development sequence)
- Guides junior developers with complete context (codebase + this doc only)
- Updates after each task completion (active document)
- Tracks progress via YAML status (project management & tracking tool)
</objective>

<agent-usage>
This command leverages specialized agents for efficiency:
- **code-researcher**: Deep codebase analysis and understanding
- **web-researcher**: Technical documentation and best practices research
These agents work autonomously with their own context windows for better performance.
</agent-usage>

<process>
  <step_1_analyze>
    • Read requirements: $ARGUMENTS
    • Extract ALL stories/features (miss nothing)
    • Ask clarifying questions immediately
    • Identify all files needing changes
    • Think hardest - be thorough
  </step_1_analyze>

  <step_2_context>
    • Use Task tool with code-researcher agent for deep codebase analysis:
      Task(
        subagent_type="code-researcher",
        description="Analyze codebase structure",
        prompt="Provide comprehensive codebase analysis: structure, architecture patterns, dependencies, key components"
      )
    • Extract architecture patterns from analysis
    • Map component relationships
  </step_2_context>

  <step_3_research>
    • Use Task tool with web-researcher agent for technical research:
      Task(
        subagent_type="web-researcher",
        description="Research technologies and best practices",
        prompt="Research framework documentation, best practices, and patterns for technologies identified in the project. Focus on official docs and current industry standards."
      )
    • Note: The web-researcher agent will automatically:
      - Use Context7 MCP for framework documentation
      - Use WebFetch for specific URLs and GitHub
      - Use Playwright MCP for dynamic sites
      - Prioritize official sources and recent information
  </step_3_research>

  <step_4_design>
    • Choose simple, robust solutions
    • Document architectural decisions
    • Order tasks by dependencies
  </step_4_design>

  <step_5_output>
    • Generate plan using structure below
    • Save as: {feature}-engineering-plan.md
  </step_5_output>
</process>

# {Feature} Engineering Plan

## Usage
1. Read at session start
2. Update status after EACH task
3. Document discoveries inline
4. Keep sections current

## Workflow
1. Verify previous story = `completed`
2. Check ALL pre_implementation flags = `true` (never skip)
3. Execute task by task systematically
4. Update `task_notes` with context (critical - only source of truth)
5. Ensure working app after EVERY step

## Recommended MCP Servers
- **Playwright**: Verify UI changes
- **Context7**: Get library docs

## Rules
- NO legacy fallback (unless explicit)
- NO backwards compatibility (unless explicit)
- Simple, robust, reiable, maintainable code
- After EACH feature: compile → test → verify
- Test external behavior (API calls, tools executed, results returned)
- Remove ALL mocks/simulations before completion
- Ask clarifying questions upfront
- Identify files to change per task
